Building CNN based Image Classfier using Keras and deploying it to Comet.

## What is Deep Learning?
A branch of machine learning is deep learning. Deep learning systems can perform better with access to more data, which is the machine equivalent of more experience, in contrast to typical machine learning algorithms, many of which have a finite ability to learn regardless of the amount of data they obtain. Machines may be trained to perform specific activities such as driving a car, spotting weeds in a field of crops, diagnosing illnesses, checking machinery for flaws, and other jobs once they have acquired sufficient experience through deep learning.
